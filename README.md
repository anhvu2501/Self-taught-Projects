# Self-taught-Projects
These are some projects that I have done in order to have a better grasp of applying Deep Learning models into a specific problem.
- Object Detection by using YOLO v3 - based on tutorial on ComputerVisionZone
- YOLOv3 using pretrained weights and network from darknet - based on a blog on machinelearningmastery
- A model trained by apply the idea of VGG-16 (just use a small number of layers) and trained on flowers dataset => Evaluation: ~98%
